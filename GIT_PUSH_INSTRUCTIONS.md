## 📋 Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: If Repository Already Exists on GitHub

If you've already created the `MOOD-TRACKER-AI` repository on GitHub:

```powershell
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MOOD-TRACKER-AI.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: If Repository Doesn't Exist Yet

1. **Create the repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `MOOD-TRACKER-AI`
   - Description: "AI-powered mood tracking and journaling web app built with Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, and modern web technologies"
   - Make it Public (for portfolio showcase)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Then run these commands:**

```powershell
# Add your repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MOOD-TRACKER-AI.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

When you push, GitHub will ask for authentication:

### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Use token as password when prompted

### Option B: GitHub CLI
```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if you haven't
winget install GitHub.cli

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 📝 Example Commands (Replace YOUR_USERNAME)

```powershell
# If YOUR_USERNAME is "johndoe", run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/MOOD-TRACKER-AI.git
git push -u origin main
```
